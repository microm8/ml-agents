For discussions, please post in [ML-Agents Unity Forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/ml-agents.453/) instead of
creating a Github issue. Unity forums are the predominant community for Unity users and experts. By leveraging Unity
forums for general discussions and project help, we can keep Github issues for bugs, performance issues, and feature
requests for ML-Agents.


**Note**: The ML-Agents team has limited resources for education and community discussion.  We'll participate as we are
able, but encourage members of the community to support one another to discuss and support one another.
